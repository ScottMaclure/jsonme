jsonmé
=======

jsonmé is a simple HTML/CSS/JS application that allows you to store your resumé's contents in a json file and display it as a nicely formatted webpage. It's built using Sizzle.js and Snack.js, two small and focused libraries instead of using a multi-pupose library like jQuery.

##usage
The easiest way to use jsonmue is to create a GitHub page for your account and copy this repo into it.  Then modify the resume.json file to match your skills/qualifications.  Sections can be excluded from the output by removing them from the json file, for instance to remove "Speaking Engagements" from the output, just remove the "speaking" key from the JSON file.
