Agile excels here. In recent years, I've enjoyed the rise in focus on quality in the frontend toolbox, and multi-device development, which I consider the strength of HTML and associated tech.",

We designed a new 'race' module for this purpose, allowing entrants to setup a profile page that can accept donations through our payment system."
