	"aboutme" : "I've loved working with the web since the earliest days of my profession. The open, rapid nature of development meant the cost of experimenting is low. This has allowed for the astounding pace of development, which is fantastic. In recent years, I've enjoyed the rise in focus on quality in the frontend toolbox, and multi-device development, which I consider the strength of HTML and associated tech.",

Built an online donation system for The Hawkesbury Canoe Classic, which allowed them to increase their donations by a significant multiplier. I believe that around 2011, total donations received through the system over a few years was over 1 million. We designed a new 'race' module for this purpose, allowing entrants to setup a profile page that can accept donations through our payment system."
